This is the source code for my macro-keyboard created with a Pro-Micro Arduino.

The current code that is published was a ground up re-write that added in licensing, better code-comments and the concept of macro pages with theoretical support up to 96 macros. The current code takes 29% of program memory on a pro-micro.
